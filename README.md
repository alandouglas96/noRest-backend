noRest is a service platform that lets you create a comprehensive no-code API in minutes. Using our server, client's can create an exentisive database within minutes and use their personalised endpoint in their own front-end projects.

This is the back-end repository. The front end repository can be found at: https://github.com/stevelagarto/noREST-Front-End
